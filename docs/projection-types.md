# Projection types
To create 360 video we need to "flatten" the 3d space. To do this there are two main projection techniques we can use.

- Equirectangular, The forward projection transforms spherical coordinates into planar coordinates. The reverse projection transforms from the plane back onto the sphere. The formulae presume a spherical model.

- Cubemap, In computer graphics, cube mapping is a method of environment mapping that uses the six faces of a cube as the map shape. The environment is projected onto the sides of a cube and stored as six square textures, or unfolded into six regions of a single texture. The cube map is generated by first rendering the scene six times from a viewpoint, with the views defined by a 90 degree view frustum representing each cube face

A shader is used to translate these projections into a 3d space.
