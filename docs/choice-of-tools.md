# Choice of tools

## Unity
Unity is a great tool that fits our needs, allowing for exports to multiple vendors such as Oculus, Vive, Mobile or Desktop. It also allows great tooling to work on prototypes.

Pros
- Strong ecosystem and language to develop in
- Lots of support for working with 360 video

Cons
- Heavy framework, impacts devices
- Requires an app, won't work on the web for example

We have chosen Unity as it best fits our needs.

## WebGL
WebGL has been around for a while now and has a great toolset to work with 3d. There are some frameworks around that help make this space alot easier to digest. For example THREE or Babylon.

Pros
- Lightweight
- Portable

Cons
- Only works for Web, needs adapters to work on different platforms
- Abstraction is high, not much tooling to play with settings.
