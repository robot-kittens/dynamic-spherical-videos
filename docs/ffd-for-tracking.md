# FFD for Tracking
Free form deformation is a technique that allows objects to be folded into 3D space.
It allows for great control by providing 9 points of control instead of 4.

Caveat; not supported as an option within major tracking tools. Postprocessing not an option as it requires a great deal of image analysis.

This approach will not work, will have to look into "old school" corner pin tracking and bringing that into a 3d space.
